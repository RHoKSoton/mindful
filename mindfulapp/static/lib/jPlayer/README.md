CirclePlayer is a demo intended to showcase the jQuery HTML5 Media Library jPlayer
[https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer) 

[Try the latest version.](http://happyworm.com/jPlayerLab/circleplayer/)   

Uses HTML5 Audio, CSS3 Transforms (transform:rotate) hooks provided by : [https://github.com/lrbabe/jquery.rotate.js](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer)

A full browser fallback is planned, jPlayer provides the Flash HTML5 Audio fallback and the idea is to use a sprite map to display progress in non CSS3 compliant browsers. [http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/](http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/) could be used to check CSS3 transform:rotate compliance. 

Possibilities exist to enhance the demo with [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API) for supporting browsers.

Note the progress bar will not function correctly in Opera 11 due to a JIT compiler bug in the Opera browser : [http://twitter.com/dstorey/status/28108260418523137](http://twitter.com/dstorey/status/28108260418523137) 

The demo's current look is heavily inspired by [http://forrst.com/posts/Untitled-CJz](http://forrst.com/posts/Untitled-CJz)
